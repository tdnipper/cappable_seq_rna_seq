    "## Quantify Reads- Alignment independent (bypass `star`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to quantify reads before counting them. `DeSeq2` can take counts from `salmon` (in fact, this is the official recommendation in the docs). In `dusp_11_clip-seq` I discussed quantification methods including simple gene counts and more sophisticated transcript counts. We'll use the genome alignments to inform transcript quantification (and maybe test alignment-independent quantification once this approach is done) in preparation to pass those results to `deseq2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Salmon` needs files aligned to the transcriptome, luckily `star` can output this. It first aligns to genome and them maps these alignments to the transcriptome, but still preserves any novel reads that don't map the provided transcriptome. (Note, this is different than the clip-seq approach because we simply wanted to find peaks in those files, not quantify reads.) However, this is an alignment-dependent approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Salmon` can quantify in an alignment-independent manner, and this method seems to be more accurate than alignment-dependent methods, counterintuitively. This is because using alignment-dependent methods (cufflinks, HTseq, FeatureCounts, maybe salmon in alignment-dependent mode) can vastly underestimate abundance from reads with >90% sequence similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kind of confusingly, while alignment-independent mapping is superior for quantification, these counts are more accurate when mapped to the genome instead of the transcriptome. This is because transcripts can have conserved UTRs and sequences as well as different spliceoforms. So the best approach here I think is to quantify in an alignment-independent manner and collapse these counts down to the gene level. This is recommended here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, I'll use salmon to map reads to transcripts without aligning, and then collapse these into counts per gene before passing to `deseq2`. This makes `star` alignment obsolete. We need a transcript index for our hybrid genome for human/WSN transcripts. This is tricky. `gffread` can take a gff file and a genome file and extract transcripts from the genome sequences using the info in the gff file, outputting a transcripts.fasta file. Simply combining the gff files and the genome files results in issues with `gffread` only extracting either human or WSN sequences for some reason. To get around this I ran `gffread` on the WSN genome using the WSN gff and the human genome using the human gff and then combined those. This should work with the combined human/WSN genome that I made for `star` to make indexes for `salmon`.\n",
