    Retrieves the filenames and filepaths from a given directory.

    Args:
        directory (str): The directory to search for files.
        prefix1 (str, optional): The prefix for the first set of files. Defaults to "_R1", but can be changed to 'fwd' for example.
        prefix2 (str, optional): The prefix for the second set of files. Defaults to "_R2", but can be changed to 'rev' for example.
        file_filter (function, optional): A function to filter files. Defaults to None. Can be used to filter out log files or non fastq, etc.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the sample names and their corresponding filepaths.
              The keys of the dictionary are the filenames split at the prefixes, and the values are nested dictionaries.
